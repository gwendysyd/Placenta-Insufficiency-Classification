# **Split approach**

Buderer's method has been used to determine the minimum number of samples (in our case patients, not images) that need to be in test. For cases when criteria could not be met due to the size of the dataset, a conventional split of 70-15-15 was applied.

## **All planes**
- **C3 all planes**: Split according to Burderer's method, with 121 women in test.
- **LBW all planes**: Split according to Burderer's method, with 151 women in test.
- **CIR all planes**: 70-15-15.
- **PRE all planes**: 70-15-15.

## **Anterior planes**
- **C3 all planes**: 70-15-15.
- **LBW all planes**: 70-15-15.
- **CIR all planes**: 70-15-15.
- **PRE all planes**: 70-15-15.
