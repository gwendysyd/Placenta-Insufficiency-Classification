# **Experiment Plan: Applying Different Architectures and Custom Transfer Learning to Placenta Ultrasound Images Datasets**

## **Purpose**
This experiment aims to systematically compare the performance of various neural network architectures on the same image dataset. By employing both basic and advanced models with different architecture sizes, with and without transfer learning, we aim to identify the most effective approaches for image analysis in this context.

## **Experimental Approach**

In this iteration, we aim to train a binary classification model using a dataset of 12,400 ultrasound images of fetal planes. The objective is to classify whether an image contains a representation of a brain. We will apply transfer learning from the brain classifier to train our placenta's data. Our approach involves several key steps and methodologies:

1. **Neural Network Architectures**: 
   - We will employ two distinct neural network architectures: VGG16 and ResNet-18. 
   - The choice of these architectures is strategic; VGG16 is known for its depth and complexity, whereas ResNet-18 is comparatively smaller and more efficient. This contrast allows us to evaluate the performance across different scales of model complexity.

2. **Training Approaches**: 
   - We plan to explore two main training approaches to train our placenta's data:
     - **Without Data Augmentation, Using Class Weights**: This method focuses on training the model on the original dataset without any artificial expansion or transformation of the data, while employing class weights to address any class imbalance.
     - **With Image Augmentation, Both With and Without Class Weights**: Here, we will enhance the dataset using image augmentation techniques (such as rotations, shifts, scaling, etc.) and assess the model's performance both with and without the application of class weights.

3. **Transfer Learning Strategy**: 
   - **For Brain Classification**:
     - We will experiment with both transfer and non-transfer learning approaches. This will allow us to understand the benefits of using pre-trained models versus training from scratch in our specific context. In this case, we add a few more custom top layers, since the size of the dataset is better than the placenta's dataset.
   - **For Placental Images**:
     - We will apply transfer learning from the brain classifier. This means the model trained to classify brain images will be used as a starting point for developing a classifier for placental images.

## **Datasets for Analysis**
- **C3 all planes**: At least one of three conditions (CIR, preeclampsia, birth weight percentile <10) is present.
- **LBW all planes**: Focus on birth weight percentile <10 only.
- **CIR all planes**: Focus on CIR only.
- **PRE all planes**: Focus on preeclampsia only.

## **Key parameters**
- **Image augmentation**: Tested with and without image augmentation.
- **Class weights**: Tested with and without class weights.
- **Placental planes**: Anterior and posterior combined.
- **Mask size**: 1:1.
