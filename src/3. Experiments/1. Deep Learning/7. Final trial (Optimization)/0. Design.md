# **Experiment Plan: Applying Different Architectures to Placenta Ultrasound Images Datasets**

## **Purpose**
This experiment aims to systematically compare the performance of various neural network architectures on the same image dataset. By employing both basic and advanced models with different architecture sizes, with and without transfer learning, we aim to identify the most effective approaches for image analysis in this context.

## **Experimental Approach**
Our objective is to identify and optimize the best-performing model for each specific criteria. The optimization process will be conducted in two primary stages:

1. **Model Retraining on Specific Planes**:
   - We will retrain the model separately on two distinct sets of image planes: ANTERIOR and POSTERIOR.
   - This stage is designed to assess and compare the model's performance when trained exclusively on each type of plane. The goal is to determine if the model performs better with images from a particular orientation, which could be crucial for our analysis.

2. **Model Tuning with Optuna**:
   - After identifying the best model—whether it's the one trained on anterior planes, posterior planes, or a combination of both—we will proceed with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
   - Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, specifically designed for machine learning. It will help us fine-tune the model to achieve the best possible performance.
   - The tuning process will focus on optimizing various parameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and neuron counts in each layer, among others, depending on the specific case.

## **Datasets for Analysis**
- **C3 all planes**: At least one of three conditions (CIR, preeclampsia, birth weight percentile <3) is present.
- **LBW all planes**: Focus on birth weight percentile <3 only.
- **CIR all planes**: Focus on CIR only.
- **PRE all planes**: Focus on preeclampsia only.
