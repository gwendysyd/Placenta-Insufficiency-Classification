# **Experiment Plan: Applying Different Architectures and Feature Extraction Techniques to Placenta Ultrasound Images Datasets**

## **Purpose**
This experiment aims to systematically compare the performance of various neural network architectures and traditional computer vision techniques on the same image dataset. By employing both deep learning models and feature-based machine learning approaches, we aim to identify the most effective strategies for image analysis in this context.

## **Datasets for Analysis**
- **C3 all planes**: At least one of three conditions (CIR, preeclampsia, birth weight percentile <3) is present.
- **LBW all planes**: Focus on birth weight percentile <3 only.
- **CIR all planes**: Focus on CIR only.
- **PRE all planes**: Focus on preeclampsia only.

## **Experimental Approach**
We will apply different neural network architectures and feature extraction techniques to the datasets in their original form to assess the effectiveness of each model and to get a baseline.

## **Neural Network and Machine Learning Architectures**
- **Basic Architectures**:
  - Basic ANN: A simple artificial neural network as a baseline.

- **VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, ResNet18 Variants**:
  - For each of these architectures, we will explore two variants: 
    - Initializing with ImageNet weights, but all weights are updated.
    - Transfer learning with ImageNet weights frozen to prevent overfitting, especially as our dataset is small.

- **Computer Vision Techniques**:
  - **Feature Extraction**:
    - HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients): To capture edge and gradient structure information from the images.
    - GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix): For texture analysis and feature extraction.
  - **Machine Learning Models**:
    - SVC (Support Vector Classifier): To classify images based on the extracted features.
    - XGBoost: An ensemble learning method for classification using extracted features.
    - Logistic Regression: A traditional statistical model for binary classification.

In this revised approach, we will explore both deep learning and traditional computer vision methodologies to understand their respective strengths and limitations in the context of placenta ultrasound image analysis.
