# **Experiment Plan: Applying Computer Vision Techniques to Placenta Ultrasound Images Datasets**

## **Purpose**
This experiment aims to systematically compare the performance of various traditional computer vision techniques on the same image dataset. By employing feature-based machine learning approaches, we aim to identify the most effective strategies for image analysis in this context.

## **Experimental Approach**
We will apply different feature extraction techniques to the datasets in their original form to assess the effectiveness of each model and to get a baseline. In this iteration, we introduce normalized class weights.

- **Computer Vision Techniques**:
  - **Feature Extraction**:
    - HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients): To capture edge and gradient structure information from the images.
    - GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix): For texture analysis and feature extraction.
  - **Machine Learning Models**:
    - SVC (Support Vector Classifier): To classify images based on the extracted features.
    - XGBoost: An ensemble learning method for classification using extracted features.
    - Logistic Regression: A traditional statistical model for binary classification.

## **Datasets for Analysis**
- **C3 all planes**: At least one of three conditions (CIR, preeclampsia, birth weight percentile <3) is present.
- **LBW all planes**: Focus on birth weight percentile <3 only.
- **CIR all planes**: Focus on CIR only.
- **PRE all planes**: Focus on preeclampsia only.

## **Key parameters**
- **Image augmentation**: Not applied.
- **Class weights**: Applied.
- **Placental planes**: Anterior and posterior combined.
- **Mask size**: 1:1.
