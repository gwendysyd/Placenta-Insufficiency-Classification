# **Experiment Plan: Applying GLCM Feature Extraction Technique to Placenta Ultrasound Images Datasets**

## **Purpose**
This experiment is designed to systematically explore the effectiveness of the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique on placenta ultrasound image datasets. We aim to determine the most effective strategies for image analysis by focusing on advanced parameter tuning in GLCM and employing softer image augmentation techniques.

## **Datasets for Analysis**
- **C3 all planes**: At least one of three conditions (CIR, preeclampsia, birth weight percentile <3) is present.
- **LBW all planes**: Focus on birth weight percentile <3 only.
- **CIR all planes**: Focus on CIR only.
- **PRE all planes**: Focus on preeclampsia only.

## **Experimental Approach**
We will apply the GLCM feature extraction technique to the datasets, using more refined parameters to enhance the quality and relevance of the extracted features. This approach is coupled with a softer image augmentation strategy, designed to enrich the dataset without introducing overly complex variations.

- **Image Augmentation**:
  - A 'softer' image augmentation approach will be used, involving less aggressive transformations to maintain the integrity of the original ultrasound images.

- **Feature Extraction with GLCM**:
  - GLCM will be employed for texture analysis and feature extraction. Refined parameters in GLCM will be used to capture more nuanced and relevant texture information from the ultrasound images.

- **Machine Learning Models for Classification**:
  - **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**: To classify images based on the features extracted via GLCM.
  - **XGBoost**: An ensemble learning method for classification, utilizing GLCM-extracted features.
  - **Logistic Regression**: A traditional statistical model for binary classification, using features derived from GLCM.

Through this focused approach, we aim to assess the potential of GLCM in extracting meaningful features from placenta ultrasound images and to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in classifying these images based on GLCM features.
