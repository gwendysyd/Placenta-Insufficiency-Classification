# **Experiment Plan: Applying GLCM Feature Extraction Technique to Placenta Ultrasound Images Datasets**

## **Purpose**
This experiment is designed to systematically explore the effectiveness of the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique on placenta ultrasound image datasets. We aim to determine the most effective strategies for image analysis by focusing on advanced parameter tuning in GLCM and employing softer image augmentation techniques.

## **Experimental Approach**
We will apply the GLCM feature extraction technique to the datasets, using refined parameters to enhance the quality and relevance of the extracted features. This approach is coupled with a softer image augmentation strategy, designed to enrich the dataset without introducing overly complex variations. We will test the approach with and without image augmentation.

- **Image Augmentation**:
  - A 'softer' image augmentation approach will be used, involving less aggressive transformations to maintain the integrity of the original ultrasound images.

- **Feature Extraction with GLCM**:
  - GLCM will be employed for texture analysis and feature extraction. Refined parameters in GLCM will be used to capture more nuanced and relevant texture information from the ultrasound images.

- **Machine Learning Models for Classification**:
  - **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**: To classify images based on the features extracted via GLCM.

## **Hyperparameter Tuning of SVC**
To optimize the performance of the SVC model, we will conduct hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. This process involves searching through a predefined grid of hyperparameters to find the most effective combination for our model. The specific parameters we are tuning include:

Test 1:
- `'C'`: Regularization parameter with values [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000].
- `'kernel'`: Kernel type with options ['rbf', 'poly'].
- `'gamma'`: Kernel coefficient with values [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5].
- `'class_weight'`: Option to balance classes [None, 'balanced'].

- Test 2 (for linear kernel):
- `'C'`: Regularization parameter with values [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000].
- `'class_weight'`: Option to balance classes [None, 'balanced'].

## **Evaluation and Retraining Strategy**
After determining the most effective technique between using image augmentation and not using it, we will select the best approach to retrain the model on different planes (ANTERIOR and POSTERIOR), to observe if there is an improvement in performance.

## **Datasets for Analysis**
- **C3 all planes**: At least one of three conditions (CIR, preeclampsia, birth weight percentile <3) is present.
- **LBW all planes**: Focus on birth weight percentile <3 only.
- **CIR all planes**: Focus on CIR only.
- **PRE all planes**: Focus on preeclampsia only.

## **Key parameters**
- **Image augmentation**: Tested with and without image augmentation.
- **Class weights**: Tuned as hyperparameter.
- **Placental planes**: Anterior, posterior, combined.
- **Mask size**: 1:1.
